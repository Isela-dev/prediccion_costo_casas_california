## Description üìÑ

In this project, we apply linear regression techniques to build a model that predicts house prices in California. We use the California housing dataset, which includes characteristics such as number of bedrooms, number of persons per household, latitude, longitude, among others.

## Functionalities ‚ú®

- Model training**: Train a linear regression model using historical data.
- Prediction**: Allows you to predict the price of a house based on its characteristics.
- Data visualization**: Includes graphs and visualizations to better understand the data and model results.
